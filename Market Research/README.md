# Background
Worked with students from my Statistics Consulting Class to analyze Questionnaire data regarding how people shop in supermarkets. This was a project that was presented to Dr. Luke Wade of the USC Marketing Dept. R, SPSS, and Tableau were some of the software and programming languages used to create visualizations and insights needed to analyze the data.

## Project Goals
- To answer the 8 research questions that were developed to analyze this data.
- To display KPI's and employ the use of visualizations and NLP to analyze the survey data.

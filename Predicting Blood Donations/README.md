As stated, the purpose of this project was to predict the number of blood donations in the given dataset [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Blood+Transfusion+Service+Center).

I chose to model the number of donations using a zero-truncated negative binomial model. I have included code in both SAS and R as well as a report documenting my findings.

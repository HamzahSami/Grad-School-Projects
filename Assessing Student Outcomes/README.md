# Background
Worked with Joey Gadbois to analyze Student learning outcomes in SAS. A 2^4-1 experimental design was programmed into SAS to properly analyze the survey data given. A further analysis of the results is documented here.

## Project Goals
- To fit the Student Survey Data using a 2^4-1 design model. 
- To determine if any of the factors: average hours of sleep, average time on social media, time spent studying for test, and commute time is significant in affecting student performance.

## Design
- Constructed the design with a defining relation producing a resolution IV design since no main effects are aliased with any other main effect or two-factor effect, but the two-factor effects are aliased with each other.

## Analysis of Variance
- After performing ANOVA, our final reduced model consisted of just three main effects and two two-factor interaction effects.

## Tukey's Multiple Comparison Procedures
- This was used to see which main effects and interaction effects were significantly different.

## Results
- After our analysis was complete, we found that the average commute time had the biggest impact on the studentsâ€™ performance on their exams. Since their class started at 7:30 AM, a long commute meant that they had to wake up earlier in the morning so when they would take their exams, they may not be fully awake.

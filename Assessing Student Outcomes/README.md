# Background
Worked with Joey Gadbois to analyze Student learning outcomes in SAS. A 2^4-1 experimental design was programmed into SAS to properly analyze the survey data given. A further analysis of the results is documented here.

## Project Goals
- To fit the Student Survey Data using a 2^4-1 design model. 
- To determine if any of the factors: average hours of sleep, average time on social media, time spent studying for test, and commute time is significant in affecting student performance.
